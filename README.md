<b> Greetings, my fellow chicky wings! My name is @Abigblueworld. </b>
- <font color=red> I’m interested in Animation, music, IT, Chatbots, programming, and playing kids games!
- <font color=orange> I’m currently learning Python and HTML!
- <font color=yellow>I am a female, I go by she/her/they/them pronouns ;)
- <font color=green>My age is 16, meaning I'm a very young female programmer.
- <font color=blue> I have PDDNOS autism, severe hypotonia, and anxiety disorder.
- <font color=purple>I only program things sometimes so I will be a little slow in making new Python/HTML creations... :/
  <br> 
Anyway, enjoy my work of arts!
