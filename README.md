<b> Greetings, my fellow chicky wings! My name is @Abigblueworld. </b>
- I’m interested in Animation, music, IT, Chatbots, programming, and playing kids games!
- I’m currently learning Python and HTML!
- I am a female, I go by she/her/they/them pronouns ;)
- My age is 16, meaning I'm a very young female programmer.
- I have atypical autism, hypotonia, and anxiety disorder.
- I only programs sometimes so I will be a little slow in making new Python/HTML creations... :/
  <br> 
Anyway, enjoy my work of arts!
