- I have brown hair and blue eyes in real life <br>
- My age is 16, but I'm turning 17 in a few days <br>
- I am Asexual, and sort of Pansexual <br>
- I am not very liked, but I try to be the best I can <br>
- I am an atheist, not a christian <br>

- I enjoy Nickelodeon, PBS Kids, Disney Junior, Cartoon Network, Nick Jr, Cartoonito (somewhat), Disney Channel, Food Network, MTV, and some TLC shows. However I do not enjoy news shows like NBC and ABC News, Comedy Central, Freeform, National Geographic and Animal Kingdom shows, since they're either bad or boring <br>
- I do like Freeform, but only when movies are on it, however we don't watch cable anymore <br>
<h4> Now, that's me!</h4>

Anyway, enjoy
